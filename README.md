# Private GPT Chatbot
This project creates a GUI for the PrivateGPT and the LocalGPT projects. 
This app is built in Electron, and to run the developer build, simply run "npm start" in the root folder. The code from the PrivateGPT / LocalGPT projects is in the LocalGPT folder. 
To interact with the GUI, I used the python-shell module for node. This app uses the basic input() CLI and gives a frontend.  
I was inspired to make this project after Snapchat released their own conversational AI. If you would like to contact me about this project, do let me know. Thank you.
